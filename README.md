# matplotlib_figure_saver

These two scripts can be helpful when one or more matplotlib figures need to be viewed interactively.

The figures will be saved with pickle (instead of cPickle for compatibility) and '.pmg' as extension (portable matplotlib graph).

Please read the example code for details.
